 * Portfolio Scheduler
 * 
 * This module handles the scheduling of portfolio snapshots at UTC midnight.
 * Instead of taking snapshots at fixed time intervals (e.g., hourly),
 * it now takes one snapshot per day at UTC midnight.
 * 
 * The implementation uses the same approach as the DailyServiceActivity
 * in the service registry, which also takes snapshots at UTC midnight.

 * Gets the timestamp for the start of the day (UTC midnight) for a given timestamp
 * This is used to determine if we've crossed into a new UTC day

 * 1. Dividing the timestamp by the day period (86400 seconds normally)
 * 2. Truncating to an integer (floor division)

 * 1628097654 / 86400 = 18843.72... (truncated to 18843)
